    "This project aims to find the correlation between movie box office and movie reviews from Amazon.com. Machine learning models are fitted and reviews used to project a movie's box office.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main parts to this project, including 1) data cleaning, 2) data analysis and 3) prediction modeling. Parts of the codes used are shown here, while the rest can be accessed on my [Github repository](https://github.com/janie128/Project-movies)."

    "The data was then filtered to include data only after May 1996, to match the Amazon review data period. Initially, the box office amounts were to be adjusted to account for inflation or cultural factors (such as perhaps higher movie-going culture), by fitting a general (upwards) trend regression analysis and factoring it out. However, over the time period, an increase in the percentage of small films (low-grossing) disrupts any such trend. In Fig. 1, the percentage of films grouped by their box office amounts ($log_{10}(gross)$) over the years is shown.  \n",
