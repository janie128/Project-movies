    "There are three main parts to this project, including 1) data scraping and cleaning, 2) feature extraction and preprocessing, and 3) prediction modeling. Parts of the codes used are shown here, while the rest can be accessed on my [Github repository](https://github.com/janie128/Project-movies)."

    "The data was then filtered to include data only after May 1996, to match the Amazon review data period. Initially, the box office amounts were to be adjusted to account for inflation or cultural factors (such as perhaps higher movie-going culture), by fitting a general (upwards) trend regression analysis and factoring it out. However, over the time period, an increase in the percentage of small films (lower-grossing) disrupts any such trend. This is evident in Fig. 1, where the percentage of movies grouped by their box office amounts ($log_{10}(gross)$) over the years is shown.  \n",

    "Amazon \"Movies & TV\" review data and their metadata files were download in JSON format, which were further parsed and output with a Python script into strict JSON format for parsing in R. Review/metadata files were labeled with product titles as opposed to specifically movie titles, and matching was required between the movie titles from the box office data set and the product titles available in the metadata file. The data matching process involved stripping punctuation, converting to lower case, removing leading \"the\" for a more comprehensive matching, and pattern matching with regular expressions.  \n",
