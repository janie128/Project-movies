### Data science project of predicting box office gross with movie reviews
  
This project aims to find the correlation between movie box office gross and movie reviews (from Amazon). Various features from the movie reviews are extracted, including: average review score, review length, review sentiment score and number of reviews. Models are fitted and used to project box office gross.
